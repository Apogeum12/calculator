## Description

Calculator is a cross-platform application created using Tauri technology with a backend in Rust and a frontend in Solid.js, using Vite. The project provides comprehensive solutions for both desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and mobile users (Android, iOS). It is a simple application serving as a base for working on more complex applications with example configurations needed for correct compilation on a given platform. It is also a project that serves as my current summary of skills as a developer.

## Features

- List of the main features of the project.
- Multi-platform support: Windows, MacOS, Linux (deb, snap, flatpak), Android, iOS.
- Web version for easy access and demonstration.
- Performance and security optimization thanks to the backend in Rust.
- Testing a new approach in building the frontend using the Bun runtime environment.
- Generation of simple two-dimensional function graphs. [In Future]
- Saving graphs as an image to a png file. [In Future]
